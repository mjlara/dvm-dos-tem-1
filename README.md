> **Whats with the name?**
> 
> `dvm-dos-tem` is short for "Dynamic Vegetation \[Model\] Dynamic Organic Soil
> Terrestrial Ecosystem Model". Orignally the model
> was simply "TEM", and as more logic and capabilities have been added, the name
> has grown. We still frequently use simply "TEM" because it is less cumbersome
> for writing and typing.


> **Sept 2022**
>
> We are in the process of updating the entire documentation
> system. There is still info scattered across this README, the wiki, a Google
> Doc and the Sphinx system but we are working on consolidating the info into 
> primarily the Sphinx system.
