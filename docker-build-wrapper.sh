# This script will build the docker images for the dvmdostem project.
# Note: Some steps may take a while, please be patient.

# Note: You may try --no-cache with the docker build commands if they
# fail with various errors reccomending --fix-missing errors.

# Here is a handy formulation for finding and deleting old docker images, 
# adjust the grep commands as necessary: 
#
#     $ docker image ls | grep dvmdostem \
#       | grep v0.5.6-87-g | awk '{print $1,$2}' | sed -e 's/ /:/g' 
#
# This can then be wrapped in a for loop that calls docker image rm to cleanup.

# Use --tags so that lightweight tags are found. Useful for local tagging
# as well as making sure that images built during the release process are 
# appropriately tagged.
GIT_VERSION=$(git describe --tags)

# This helps with sharing host folders to container. It is important that the
# user in the container has the same uid/gid as the host user so that both
# users can have read and write permissions on the files. In many circumstances
# this build wrapper script will be run with sudo, so we have to find the id 
# of the login user, not the sudo user, to pass into the guest.
export HOSTUID=$(id -u $(logname))
export HOSTGID=$(id -g $(logname))

# used to create the dvmdostem binary so that it can be copied into
# the lean run image.
