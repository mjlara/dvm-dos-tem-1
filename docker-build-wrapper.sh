# This script will build the docker images for the dvmdostem project.
# Note: Some steps may take a while, please be patient.

# Note: You may try --no-cache with the docker build commands if they
# fail with various errors reccomending --fix-missing errors.

# Here is a handy formulation for finding and deleting old docker images, 
# adjust the grep commands as necessary: 
#
#     $ docker image ls | grep dvmdostem \
#       | grep v0.5.6-87-g | awk '{print $1,$2}' | sed -e 's/ /:/g' 
#
# This can then be wrapped in a for loop that calls docker image rm to cleanup.
