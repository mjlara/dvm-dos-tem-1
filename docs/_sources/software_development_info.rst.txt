Documentation
*************

There are several places that you will find information about ``dvmdostem``:

 * README file(s)
 * This document (which is the formatted output of the ``.rst`` source files).
   It is likely that you are reading this document where it has been published 
   online; if you build the documentation locally, then by default, the output
   ends up in ``docs_src/sphinx/build/html``.
 * The ``--help`` flag for dvmdostem and many of the scripts in the ``scripts/``
   directory.
 * Comments in the code.
 * Github wiki (hopefully deprecated soon).
 * The ``docs_src/*/html`` folders after running Doxygen or Sphinx.

Each of these locations has a different sort of information you might find 
there:

 * README files are overviews of a repository or project. Used as a rough 
   introduction, installation instructions and links to other resources.
 * This document which has several chapters: 
      - :ref:`DVM-DOS-TEM_Model_Overview<dvm-dos-tem_model_overview:Structure>`
         which is a  narrative, scientific description of the ``dvmdostem`` 
         model.
      - :ref:`Software Development Info<software_development_info:Documentation>`
        (this chapter) which contains all the other programming, usage and 
        workflow information for hands on work with the model.
      - Running ``dvmdostem`` with info and examples for hands on use of the 
        model.
      - Several other chapters, available in the table of contents.
 * The ``--help`` flags generally have usage information for software at hand.

In a perfect world most of the comments in the code will eventually be 
formatted in such a way that they can be picked up by tools such as Doxygen 
(for C++) and Sphinx (for Python). But because that is a work in progress it is
still helpful to browse the code especially for implementation details about 
the code.

We used the Github Wiki for several years, but we are trying to move away 
from it towards a more robust, fully featured platform that integrates better 
with CI/CD tooling. Github Wiki might be a good place to keep certain 
tutorial-like information.

In the current implementation with Sphinx (used to format this document), we 
have a ``docs_src`` folder within which is a subdirectory for each 
documentation tool (presently Doxygen and Sphinx). Each tool is setup to put 
its outputs in its own directory. To publish outputs, the contents are copied 
to the ``docs/`` directory in the root of the repo and then pushed to the 
``gh-pages`` branch of the upstream repo.

==================
Note about images
==================
Including images in documentation presents similar challenges for raw, 
rendered, and word processing systems. One choice is whether to embed the 
image directly or provide a link to it. And another choice has to do with how 
to version control the image and make it easy to update in the future.

The simplest solution is to simply not worry about it and commit the ``.png`` 
or ``.jpg`` files directly to the repo. This certainly works, but imagine a 
scenario where you need to update the image, say to fix a typo. If you were
the original creator, then you open the drawing file (e.g. Photoshop, Visio, 
Open Office Draw; whatever you used to create the image) edit the image, 
export it, move it into the documentation structure, overwriting the original, 
and commit the result to version control. This assumes that you have the 
original image. If you don’t (either because you lost it, or perhaps you were 
not the original creator, then you must completely redraw the image from 
scratch, which is ridiculous in many cases.

One way to solve this is to commit the original image file to version 
control (e.g. the ``.ps`` or ``.dwg`` file) alongside the exported image that
will be included in the documentation. This is essentially the same dilemma 
as with the raw → generated text documentation. However drawing files 
typically don’t read well with file diffs, so it is hard to tell what changed
with the images, making it important to have good commit messages and keep 
the exported files as well. And keeping all these binary files uses quite a 
bit more space than plain text files, so it is easy for the size of the 
repository to get out of control.

A novel solution that we discovered for this problem is to use linked 
Google Drawing documents roughly as follows:

 #. Make a Google Drawing and save it (with a name)
 #. Click the Share button
 #. Edit the preferences so that the drawing is viewable to anybody with 
    the link
 #. Under File menu select "Publish to Web"
 #. Select "Embed"
 #. Copy the embed link 
 #. Paste the link into the appropriate place in your document

For each type of document there might be a different way to render the link, 
and this may not be possible in all languages/environments. In the Github 
wiki, which uses, Markdown, including something like this will allow the 
image to render, directly from Google Docs when someone loads the page:

.. code:: html

   <!-- From Tobey Carman's google drawing "dvmdostem-general-idea-science"-->
   <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17AWgyjGv3fWRLhEPX7ayJKSZt3AXcBILXN2S-FGQHeY/pub?w=960&amp;h=720">

If the original Google Drawing is updated, then the drawing seen in the wiki 
will be updated too. Take caution with the permissions granted for editing 
on the original drawing!

.. warning:: 
   
   Soure drawings for this document should probably be stored in the 
   Shared Google Drive so that they are not tied to an individual's account.

In Google Docs, there is a way to insert a Google Drawing from a menu: 
Insert > Drawing > From Drive.

With Sphinx, use the ``:raw:: html`` directive. The Sphinx documentation warns
against abusing the ``:raw::`` directive, so this might not be a good long 
term solution but it could be useful for creating a bunch of the drawings 
while they are in draft stages. 

We have not tested this approach with a system such as Doxygen but assume it 
should work. This solution is not perfect, downsides include:

 * Drawing is not strictly version controlled along with other content 
   (Google Drawings offers some version control but this would not be 
   linked to the ``dvmdostem`` git repository).
 * The end user must have web connectivity to see the drawings.


*****************************
Software Development Patterns
*****************************
At the highest level, the process of software development is simply “write 
some code (instructions) and get a machine to carry out the instructions”. 
At the end of the day, this is all we are trying to accomplish. However the 
situation is never simple and there are an infinite number of ways to 
accomplish such a seemingly simple task. When a computer programmer talks 
about toolchains and environment they are talking about the setup for the 
process of “write code and make a machine run it”. There is no single best 
way to set up your environment, and each person has their own needs and 
preferences. Sometimes there are constraints due to hardware (i.e. working 
on a High Performance Computing system or a tiny embedded microprocessor), 
sometimes the constraints come from available software tools or the skills 
of the people writing the code. You will encounter a variety of patterns for 
the environments and toolchains used in this project. Understanding these 
patterns will help you select the best way to perform your work and have 
it mesh with the existing project.

Usually when you start writing some code you are in a purely exploratory 
and experimental mode and you reach for whatever environment and toolchain 
is comfortable and close at hand. Once your code has matured and you want to 
make it available to someone else, you need to put some thought into the 
environment and toolchain for working with the code. Also as your code 
grows in complexity, different environments make certain operations 
easier or harder.

The majority of the dvmdostem code is designed to be run via command line 
interface (CLI), meaning it is expected that you have a terminal (presumably 
bash or something similar) on an Ubuntu-like operating system. You are 
expected to interact with the programs by running the scripts or compiled 
binaries from the command line (REPL).

Following is a brief overview of a variety of different programming 
environments and toolchain patterns.

=============================================
Read Eval Print Loop (REPL, shell, terminal)
=============================================
REPL stands for "**R**\ ead **E**\ val **P**\ rint **L**\ oop". The REPL can 
be written in nearly any language and can be designed to interpret nearly 
any language. Users may be familiar with a number of REPL implementations 
including the basic Python interpreterprompt (``>>>``), the IPython 
interpreter prompt (``[In 0]:``), and R prompt (``>``) orsimply the 
terminal prompt in their shell of choice (commonly bash). A REPL typically 
ingests one line of text, follows the instructions, and returns the user 
to the prompt. This is handy for prototyping, but quickly becomes tedious 
to type if you have multi-line instructions (code). For this reason there 
is the concept of a script which provides a means for submitting multiple 
lines of code to a REPL

=============================================
GUI Application
=============================================
Common, intuitive for exploration. User uses a mouse and keyboard to click 
buttons and interact with the software. May be written in a wide variety 
of languages, but typically requires a “framework” of existing code that 
helps with common patterns. Frameworks you might hear of are: Tcl/Tkinter, 
QT, Cocoa, Swing, SWT, Delphi.

=============================================
Interpreted Program (script)
=============================================
An interpreted programming language is translated from human-written 
code (instructions) into computer instructions (machine language) 
on-the-fly. Python is an interpreted language meaning that there is not 
an explicit compile step required to run the program. You simply submit 
the script (your Python code) to the Python interpreter and it is 
translated into machine code on the fly.

=============================================
Compiled Program (binary)
=============================================
A compiled programming language required a dedicated “build step” to translate
the human-written code (instructions) into machine code. The result of the build
step is an object file or a “compiled binary”. The main dvmdostem binary is a
compiled C++ program. When the source code is modified, you must run make to
re-compile the project and create a new binary object file before running it.

=============================================
Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
=============================================
Typically this is a GUI application that bundles together a bunch of handing 
tools into one package. In general the tools are:

 * Text editor
 * REPL
 * Debugger
 * Build tools
 * File browser

There are many different IDEs each with their own advantages and disadvantages. 
Often IDEs are particularly suited to a certain language (i.e. PyCharm for 
Python, Eclipse for C/C++, etc).


=============================================
IPython
=============================================
IPython is simply an enhanced REPL for Python. It comes with heaps of extra 
features that make life easier, including support for multi-line statements, 
built-in help, auto-complete features, and much more.

=============================================
Basic IDE
=============================================
All you really need for writing compiled or interpreted programs are a text 
editor and a terminal that will let you compile the program (if necessary) 
and execute it.

=============================================
Jupyter Notebook
=============================================
This is a novel addition to the traditional programming toolset. Jupyter 
Notebooks combine features of:

 * an advanced (enhanced) REPL, 
 * an IDE,
 * formatted writing/documentation system and,
 * run-time for the program.

This is accomplished using a client server architecture. In order to execute 
the code in a Jupyter Notebook, you must also run (or connect to) a 
“Notebook Server” which is a python environment and run-time. One advantage 
of this is that the client portion can be an interactive web page that is 
viewable for anyone with a standard web browser - provided they can make 
requests to a functioning backend server which provides the Python run-time.

The server can actually run a variety of languages, so it is possible to 
use R or Julia or a number of other languages as the notebook code cell 
language.

Notebooks are great for:
 * Intermingling code and documentation or explanations (formatted text)
 * Experimenting with small code snippets
 * Presenting interactive plots from remote servers without needing an 
   XWindow or other ``DISPLAY`` forwarding system
 * Developing and prototyping code

Notebooks are challenging for:
 * Version control
 * Writing code that is easy to run in a non-notebook environment 
   (library code)
 * Groups that do not have the bandwidth or abilities for running individual
   notebook servers or to run and maintain a central notebook server
 * Debugging certain types of process


=============================================
Virtual Machine
=============================================
In order to wrap up an environment such that you can preserve it or pass it 
to someone else, people have devised the concept of a Virtual Machine (VM). 
In 2022, there are innumerable ways to run a VM (VMware, Parallels, 
Multipass, Docker, etc), each with its own tradeoffs. The important thing 
to remember is that a Virtual Machine attempts to encapsulate an environment. 
Each of the items in the above list (Notebook, IPython, IDE, etc) might be 
able to run inside a virtual machine. If you are not provided with a 
perfectly functioning environment it is often up to you to understand what 
you need for an execution context and set it up for yourself; a VM of some 
variety frequently provides some way to achieve this.

*****************************
Version Management
*****************************
The primary reasons for using a version management system for  ``dvmdostem`` 
are:

 * To maintain a meaningful history of the codebase so that the provenance
   of the code is not in question.
 * To facilitate the addition or modification of code by many developers.
 * To maintain the ability to revert to or recover specific points in the 
   history of the codebase. This may be for the purpose of duplicating prior
   work, or to recover a lost behavior of the software, or both.

There are two (related) parts to fulfilling the above goals:

 * Making the commits (file diffs) easy to read and understand.
 * Having a strategy or pattern for bringing different lines of development
   together.

If the file diffs are unreadable or the lines of development are not brought 
together in an organized fashion, then the project history is harder to trust
which brings into question the provenance of the code, and makes it harder for
people to contribute.

===========================
Version Control and Hosting
===========================
This project is using Git for version control and Github for hosting. The 
primary fork of the code (referred to as “upstream”) is currently hosted under 
the ua-snap organization [#]_, so the primary (upstream) repository address is: 
https://github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem.

.. note::
   * The Source Control Management (SCM) or Version Control software is 
     named ``git``.
   * ``git`` is really a general tool for managing a certain type of data 
     structure (Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG for the curious). As such, there 
     are many ways it can be used correctly and it is up to each group to find
     a pattern that works for the project.
   * Github is a website that uses git and provides web hosting as well as other 
     features such as access management, wikis, issue tracking, and support for 
     automated workflow and actions.

The ``dvmdostem`` code is open source and the repository is publicly available 
and can be cloned by any interested party. However write access to the 
upstream repository is only granted to trusted collaborators. We gladly 
accept contributions to the code via pull request from anyone, but the pull 
request will have to be merged by a collaborator with write access to the 
upstream repo. See the branching and workflow sections below for more details.

.. [#] As of April 2022, this is true; we anticipate moving to a new 
       Github Organization in the next 6 months or so. 

--------------
Getting Help
--------------
General Git help is beyond the scope of this document. Here a few key concepts
that this document assumes you are familiar with:

 * What is a commit.
 * What is a SHA id.
 * Difference between a fork and a clone.
 * Difference between git push, pull, fetch, and pull request (PR).
 * Difference between git branch, merge and rebase.

Here are several recommendations for general Git help:

 * https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
 * https://www.atlassian.com/git
 * http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices

.. note::
   It is important to make commits that are concise, organized, and readable, 
   thus fulfilling the goals of using a version control system. This comes 
   down to using git on a day-to-day basis and learning:
  
   * what is a commit,
   * how to write a good commit message,
   * how to separate different concerns into different commits,
   * how to fine tune a commit (interactive rebase, amend and when 
     to use it),
   * understanding what types of files or information should not be kept 
   * under version control,
   * how to use branches,
   * how to merge branches, and
   * the implications of making merges in an environment with multiple 
     developers.

-------
Tools
-------
It is possible to use ``git`` purely from the command line, and in many 
cases this is the easiest way to go. However for some people and some 
situations a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is really helpful. Find a solution 
that works for you and your computing platform! There are generally two major 
functions of the Git GUIs, sometimes bundled in one application, and 
sometimes not:

 * Viewing the project history.
 * Adding to the project history (making commits, pushing, pulling, 
   merging, rebasing).

In 2022 there are many many graphical front ends to Git, and many text 
editors and IDEs have built in support for at least some Git features. You 
will need to find a tool that works for you. Although the interfaces look 
antiquated, you might find that the programs Gitk (history viewer) and 
Git Gui (for making commits) are perfectly sufficient, and these are 
readily available on most systems. At the end of the day you are likely to 
use a combination of the command line interface and a graphical frontend tool.

-------
Setup
-------
Your Git remote repositories should be appropriately named. This document 
assumes that you are using the following convention:

* The remote named origin should generally point to your fork of the 
  codebase, so the URL will look something like: 
  ``https://github.com/<your user name>/dvm-dos-tem``.
* The remote named ``upstream`` should generally point to
  ``https://github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem`` or
  ``git@github.com:ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem.git`` if you will be contributing.

It is strongly encouraged that you go to the effort of making sure your current
git branch is displayed in your terminal shell prompt. There are many examples
floating around online of how to achieve this for all major operating systems
and shells; one example `here
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15883416/adding-git-branch-on-the-bash-command-prompt>`_ 


==================
Branching Model
==================

A generalized view of our branching model can be seen in the diagram:

.. raw:: html

    <!--From Google Drawing in
    Shared Drive > DVM-DOS-TEM Documentation > drawings > branching_model
    -->
    <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRnnwNqLaMeWfcvUPI1BK47KVBAYJSGnOWoD_0fqoBwx27oRM1idQvZ0sS1Yaebr6bl7AcmNB1oAAjw/pub?w=960&amp;h=720">

The image shows one long-running branch (red commits; ``master``), three topic
branches (green commits; ``issue-47``, ``modify-dvm``, and ``bugfix-4``) and
three “experiment branches'' (gray commits; ``exp-iem-0``, ``exp-akyrb-0``,
``exp-QCF-SA``). 

Two of the topic branches have been merged (blue arrows). One of the topic
branches (``modify-dvm``) will be merged in the future (dotted blue arrow). The
dark red commits on the master branch have been tagged to make an official
release of the code. The gray commits are for “experiment branches” which are
used to track a specific model run or set of model runs. Often the changes on
these branches are only to config and parameter files, but some experiments
might require code changes as well.

This diagram does not explicitly show interaction between multiple developers;
assume that each commit in the drawing could be made by any of the trusted
collaborators with push access to the upstream repository.

As a basic safety feature we have placed a restriction on the master branch of
the upstream repository such that only the administrators (tcarman2@alaska.edu
and rarutter@alaska.edu ) are allowed push access. This restriction makes it
unlikely that a trusted collaborator can accidentally push something that breaks
the master branch. The best way for trusted collaborators to get code into the
``upstream/master`` is to open a pull request from their topic branch (e.g.
``upstream/topic-foo-bar``) into ``upstream/master`` using the Github web
interface for pull requests. All interested parties then have an opportunity to
review the code, comment on Github, and push new commits to the topic branch (if
necessary). Only the administrators can merge the pull request. 

As a general practice we try to have most work done in topic branches and merged
into master using Github pull requests. For some small changes (usually for
details that were inadvertently excluded from a recent pull request) we will
make commits directly on the master branch without using the topic branch/pull
request process. Using the topic branch/pull request process helps to organize
work and will provide a convenient place to run Github Actions, for example an
action to run the test suite before green-lighting a pull request for merging.

Recently (2022 and the several years prior) we have been using a single
long-running branch (``master``) and have been able to manage all contributions
by periodically merging topic branches. If the need arises we can switch back to
using an additional long-running branch. This would allow different levels of
stability as described in the `Git Book Branching Workflows
section <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows>`_.

In the event that you need work from ``upstream/master`` in order to continue
the work on your topic branch, you can periodically merge ``upstream/master``
into your topic branch. However please only use this when absolutely necessary
as it can make the history harder to read and the pull requests harder to
review. See this :ref:`Note <merge or rebase>` for a description of one
potential problem with merges.

.. _merge or rebase:
.. note:: 
    One problem with casually using merges in a workflow as opposed to using
    rebase is that the default merge messages can: 

     * Clutter the history.
     * Be very confusing if you end up changing a branch name at a later date.

    For instance if you have a long-running branch with a large feature you are
    working on and you need to get updates from upstream, if you choose to merge
    into your "long-running-branch": 

    .. code:: shell
        
        $ git checkout long-running-branch
        (long-running-branch)$ git pull upstream master

    Then you will get a merge message by default that starts with something like this:

    .. code:: shell

        Merge branch 'master' from github.com:ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem into 'long-running-branch'

    All well and good, but later, once you work has evolved, you may decide to
    change the name of long-running-branch to something more relevant:

    .. code:: shell
        
        (long-running-branch)$ git checkout -b more-descriptive-name
        (more-descriptive-name)$ git branch -D long-running-branch

    While renaming the branch is not a problem in and of itself, the merge commit
    title will contain "...into 'long-running-branch'". The long- running-branch no
    longer exists! So the merge commit message will be confusing to anyone who was
    not involved with long-running-branch or forgot about it. Without good commit
    messages, it is harder to understand the history and without a good
    understanding of the history it is easy to lose control of the project. So
    please learn to use rebase and merge appropriately!


===========
Workflow
===========
We are primarily using the “Centralized Workflow” described in the Git Book
`Distributed Workflows
<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows>`_. We have
a number of trusted developers at collaborating institutions and we grant them
write (push) access to the upstream repository. With this model, each developer
can push directly from their local repository to the upstream repository -
developers do not need to maintain their personal forks on Github (but are free
to do so if they wish).

If you are not one of our trusted collaborators and have contributions to make,
then you will need to follow the Git Book “Integration Manager Workflow”. You
will simply fork the upstream repository on Github, clone to your computer and
push changes back to your fork. You can then make a pull request from your fork
into the ``upstream/master``.

When two or more developers want or need to work contemporaneously on a topic
branch, it is up to the developers to communicate and make sure that they do not
step on each other's toes. In practice this simply amounts to communicating with
other folks via email, the Arctic Eco Modeling Slack Workspace, or Github Issues
and remembering to run ``git pull --rebase``. Using ``--rebase`` prevents
unnecessary merge commits that can make the history confusing and harder to
trust. 

.. _What not to track:
.. note::
    A big part of maintaining a low friction workflow revolves around
    understanding what types of files or information should not be included in
    version control and figuring out how to exclude these files. The general
    idea is that you don't want to keep generated files (e.g.: ``*.o``, or
    Doxygen output), but you do want to track code that can generate certain
    outputs. If you need the outputs, then you run the generating code to
    produce it. The general rule is don’t track files that you can generate,
    track the code to generate them.


.. _Personal settings:
.. note::
    Another common sticking point is figuring out how to track host specific
    settings, such as specific environment variables, build settings, or the
    project settings files generated by many IDEs. You may need to devise your
    own way to track these settings locally on an individual developer or
    workstation level without pushing them to the central shared repository.


.. _git stash:
.. note::
    Learn to use ``git-stash``, it is very handy for setting aside work before 
    pulling or rebasing from upstream so as to prevent unnecessary merge 
    commits!


.. _git pull with rebase:
.. note::
