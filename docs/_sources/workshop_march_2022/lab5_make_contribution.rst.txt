March 2022 Workshop Lab 5
##########################

This lab takes you through one possible workflow using Git and Github to make a
modification to the codebase and have it included upstream. This is a somewhat
simplified case and does not cover every situation you will run into. This is
also not a basic Git tutorial and it assumes that you already are familiar with:
 
 - Installing Git on your system. 
 - Working with the command line on your system.
 - Making commits using Git.
 - Browsing repositories on the Github website.
 - Viewing Git history, either with git log or a GUI program.
 - Rough understanding of the following git concepts: 
   commits, staging, branches, merging, rebasing, repositories, 
   remote repositories, and Git vs Github. 

This tutorial also assumes that you have: 
 
 - Cloned a copy of the dvm-dos-tem repository to your system. 
 - A functioning development environment with your cloned copy of the code. 
 - A Github account. 
 - The ability to set up ssh keys for access to your Github account. (optional)
 - Been added as a collaborator with write access to the 
   http://github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem repository.

Begin by reading the Version Management section of this document for an overview
of how the dvmdostem project uses Git and Github.
