   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ``dvmdostem``'s documentation!
==========================================

.. note::
     This project is under active development.
  
DVM-DOS-TEM is a process based bio-geo-chemical terrestrial biosphere
model. It operates on spatially explicit grid cells or pixels and can
advance each grid cell or pixel through a variety of processes and
time-steps.

.. note:: What’s with the name?
   Sometimes we write dvmdostem, sometimes we write dvm-dos-tem and
   sometimes we write DVM-DOS-TEM. These are all the same thing. 
   The order is always the same, but sometimes we use capitals and 
   sometimes lower case, sometimes with hyphens and sometimes without. 
   This is a fluke of history. In some cases it looks better capitalized,
   sometimes it looks better lower case. The repository ended up with 
   hyphens in the name, but the compiled binary executable does not 
   have hyphens.
