Manual Calibration

This should be a description of using the dynamic plotter and manually
adjusting parameters with the ``--cal-mode`` flag.

This section of text will describe the technical side of setting up and using
the tools to carry out the process described in 
:ref:`Calibration Process <calibration:Calibration Process - Conceptual>`.

This is from a software perspective - how to setup the tools and use them together 
to carry out the process.
