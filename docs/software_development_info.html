<p>This chapter should include all the useful information that you will need to
make contributions to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dvmdostem</span></code> project.</p>
<section id="languages-software-structure">
<h2>Languages, Software Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#languages-software-structure" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The core model (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dvmdostem</span></code>) is written in C++, while most of the supporting
tooling is written in Python. There are also an assortment of bash scripts, R
code, and IPython Notebooks floating around for various tasks.</p>
<p>The core code is compiled with a basic Makefile. This documentation is written
in reStrutured Text and Sphinx and is also compiled with a Makefile.</p>
</section>
<section id="documentation">
<h2>Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There are several places that you will find information about <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dvmdostem</span></code>,
each with a different type of info:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>README file(s) - overviews of a repository or project. Used as a rough
introduction, installation instructions and links to other resources.</p></li>
<li><p>This document (which is the formatted output of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rst</span></code> source files).
The document is split into several chapters:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">

<p>It is likely that you are reading this document where it has been published

ends up in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docs_src/sphinx/build/html</span></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Doxygen output. Similar to Sphinx, Doxygen is a documentation processing tool
that scans source files and can create a variety of output formats. Doxygen
for this project is configured to analyze the C++ source files and generate
an interactive html page with detailed call graphs and text parsed from the

<p>In a perfect world most of the comments in the code will eventually be
formatted in such a way that they can be picked up by tools such as Doxygen
(for C++) and Sphinx (for Python). But because that is a work in progress it is
still helpful to browse the code especially for implementation details about
the code.</p>
<p>We used the Github Wiki for several years, but we are trying to move away
from it towards a more robust, fully featured platform that integrates better
with CI/CD tooling. Github Wiki might be a good place to keep certain
tutorial-like information.</p>
<p>To build the Sphinx documentation (this document) locally, then do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> docs_src/sphinx
$ make clean <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> make html

<h3>Publishing<a class="headerlink" href="#publishing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>In the current implementation with Sphinx (used to format this document), we
have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docs_src</span></code> folder within which is a subdirectory for each documentation
tool (presently Doxygen and Sphinx). Each tool is setup to put its outputs in
its own directory. To publish outputs, the contents are copied to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docs/</span></code>
directory in the root of the repo and then pushed to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gh-pages</span></code> branch of
the upstream repo. Pushing to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gh-pages</span></code> branch leverages the free
publishing available from Github and is a simple way to make the documentation
publicly available. See the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">publish_github_pages.sh</span></code> for more details.
Automated publishing (e.g. for each release) is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>Currently the Sphinx documentation is designed to be published to Github
Pagesand the Doxygen documentation is only intended for local use.</p>

<section id="note-about-images">
<h3>Note about images<a class="headerlink" href="#note-about-images" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Including images in documentation presents similar challenges for raw,
rendered, and word processing systems. One choice is whether to embed the
image directly or provide a link to it. And another choice has to do with how
to version control the image and make it easy to update in the future.</p>
<p>The simplest solution is to simply not worry about it and commit the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.png</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.jpg</span></code> files directly to the repo. This certainly works, but imagine a
scenario where you need to update the image, say to fix a typo. If you were
the original creator, then you open the drawing file (e.g. Photoshop, Visio,
Open Office Draw; whatever you used to create the image) edit the image,
export it, move it into the documentation structure, overwriting the original,
and commit the result to version control. This assumes that you have the
original image. If you don’t (either because you lost it, or perhaps you were
not the original creator, then you must completely redraw the image from
scratch, which is ridiculous in many cases.</p>
<p>One way to solve this is to commit the original image file to version
control (e.g. the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.ps</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.dwg</span></code> file) alongside the exported image that
will be included in the documentation. This is essentially the same dilemma
as with the raw → generated text documentation. However drawing files
typically don’t read well with file diffs, so it is hard to tell what changed
with the images, making it important to have good commit messages and keep
the exported files as well. And keeping all these binary files uses quite a
bit more space than plain text files, so it is easy for the size of the
repository to get out of control.</p>
<p>A novel solution that we discovered for this problem is to use linked
Google Drawing documents roughly as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Make a Google Drawing and save it (with a name)</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Share button</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the preferences so that the drawing is viewable to anybody with
the link</p></li>
<li><p>Under File menu select “Publish to Web”</p></li>
<li><p>Select “Embed”</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the embed link</p></li>
<li><p>Paste the link into the appropriate place in your document</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For each type of document there might be a different way to render the link,
and this may not be possible in all languages/environments. In the Github
wiki, which uses, Markdown, including something like this will allow the
image to render, directly from Google Docs when someone loads the page:</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">&lt;!-- From Tobey Carman&#39;s google drawing &quot;dvmdostem-general-idea-science&quot;--&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">img</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17AWgyjGv3fWRLhEPX7ayJKSZt3AXcBILXN2S-FGQHeY/pub?w=960&amp;amp;h=720&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the original Google Drawing is updated, then the drawing seen in the wiki
will be updated too. Take caution with the permissions granted for editing
on the original drawing!</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Soure drawings for this document should probably be stored in the
Shared Google Drive so that they are not tied to an individual’s account.</p>
</div>
<p>In Google Docs, there is a way to insert a Google Drawing from a menu:
Insert &gt; Drawing &gt; From Drive.</p>
<p>With Sphinx, use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:raw::</span> <span class="pre">html</span></code> directive. The Sphinx documentation warns
against abusing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:raw::</span></code> directive, so this might not be a good long
term solution but it could be useful for creating a bunch of the drawings
while they are in draft stages.</p>
<p>We have not tested this approach with a system such as Doxygen but assume it
should work. This solution is not perfect, downsides include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Drawing is not strictly version controlled along with other content
(Google Drawings offers some version control but this would not be
linked to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dvmdostem</span></code> git repository).</p></li>
<li><p>The end user must have web connectivity to see the drawings.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="software-development-patterns">
<h2>Software Development Patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#software-development-patterns" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>At the highest level, the process of software development is simply “write
some code (instructions) and get a machine to carry out the instructions”.
At the end of the day, this is all we are trying to accomplish. However the
situation is never simple and there are an infinite number of ways to
accomplish such a seemingly simple task. When a computer programmer talks
about toolchains and environment they are talking about the setup for the
process of “write code and make a machine run it”. There is no single best
way to set up your environment, and each person has their own needs and
preferences. Sometimes there are constraints due to hardware (i.e. working
on a High Performance Computing system or a tiny embedded microprocessor),
sometimes the constraints come from available software tools or the skills
of the people writing the code. You will encounter a variety of patterns for
the environments and toolchains used in this project. Understanding these
patterns will help you select the best way to perform your work and have
it mesh with the existing project.</p>
<p>Usually when you start writing some code you are in a purely exploratory
and experimental mode and you reach for whatever environment and toolchain
is comfortable and close at hand. Once your code has matured and you want to
make it available to someone else, you need to put some thought into the
environment and toolchain for working with the code. Also as your code
grows in complexity, different environments make certain operations
easier or harder.</p>
<p>The majority of the dvmdostem code is designed to be run via command line
interface (CLI), meaning it is expected that you have a terminal (presumably
bash or something similar) on an Ubuntu-like operating system. You are
expected to interact with the programs by running the scripts or compiled
binaries from the command line (REPL).</p>
<p>Following is a brief overview of a variety of different programming
environments and toolchain patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read Eval Print Loop (REPL, shell, terminal)
REPL stands for “<strong>R</strong>ead <strong>E</strong>val <strong>P</strong>rint <strong>L</strong>oop”. The REPL can
be written in nearly any language and can be designed to interpret nearly
any language. Users may be familiar with a number of REPL implementations
including the basic Python interpreterprompt (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>), the IPython
interpreter prompt (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[In</span> <span class="pre">0]:</span></code>), and R prompt (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>) orsimply the
terminal prompt in their shell of choice (commonly bash). A REPL typically
ingests one line of text, follows the instructions, and returns the user
to the prompt. This is handy for prototyping, but quickly becomes tedious
to type if you have multi-line instructions (code). For this reason there
is the concept of a script which provides a means for submitting multiple
lines of code to a REPL</p></li>
<li><p>GUI Application
Common, intuitive for exploration. User uses a mouse and keyboard to click
buttons and interact with the software. May be written in a wide variety
of languages, but typically requires a “framework” of existing code that
helps with common patterns. Frameworks you might hear of are: Tcl/Tkinter,
QT, Cocoa, Swing, SWT, Delphi.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpreted Program (script)
An interpreted programming language is translated from human-written
code (instructions) into computer instructions (machine language)
on-the-fly. Python is an interpreted language meaning that there is not
an explicit compile step required to run the program. You simply submit
the script (your Python code) to the Python interpreter and it is
translated into machine code on the fly.</p></li>
<li><p>Compiled Program (binary) A compiled programming language required a dedicated
“build step” to translate the human-written code (instructions) into machine
code. The result of the build step is an object file or a “compiled binary”.
The main dvmdostem binary is a compiled C++ program. When the source code is
modified, you must run make to re-compile the project and create a new binary
object file before running it.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Typically this is a GUI application that bundles together a bunch of handing
tools into one package. In general the tools are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Text editor</p></li>
<li><p>REPL</p></li>
<li><p>Debugger</p></li>
<li><p>Build tools</p></li>
<li><p>File browser</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are many different IDEs each with their own advantages and disadvantages.
Often IDEs are particularly suited to a certain language (i.e. PyCharm for
Python, Eclipse for C/C++, etc).</p>
</li>
<li><p>IPython
IPython is simply an enhanced REPL for Python. It comes with heaps of extra
features that make life easier, including support for multi-line statements,
built-in help, auto-complete features, and much more.</p></li>
<li><p>Basic IDE
All you really need for writing compiled or interpreted programs are a text
editor and a terminal that will let you compile the program (if necessary)
and execute it.</p></li>
<li><p>Jupyter Notebook
This is a novel addition to the traditional programming toolset. Jupyter
Notebooks combine features of:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>an advanced (enhanced) REPL,</p></li>
<li><p>an IDE,</p></li>
<li><p>formatted writing/documentation system and,</p></li>
<li><p>run-time for the program.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is accomplished using a client server architecture. In order to execute
the code in a Jupyter Notebook, you must also run (or connect to) a
“Notebook Server” which is a python environment and run-time. One advantage
of this is that the client portion can be an interactive web page that is
viewable for anyone with a standard web browser - provided they can make
requests to a functioning backend server which provides the Python run-time.</p>
<p>The server can actually run a variety of languages, so it is possible to
use R or Julia or a number of other languages as the notebook code cell
language.</p>
<p>Notebooks are great for:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Intermingling code and documentation or explanations (formatted text)</p></li>
<li><p>Experimenting with small code snippets</p></li>
<li><p>Presenting interactive plots from remote servers without needing an XWindow or other <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DISPLAY</span></code> forwarding system</p></li>
<li><p>Developing and prototyping code</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Notebooks are challenging for:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Version control</p></li>
<li><p>Writing code that is easy to run in a non-notebook environment (library code)</p></li>
<li><p>Groups that do not have the bandwidth or abilities for running individual notebook servers or to run and maintain a central notebook server</p></li>
<li><p>Debugging certain types of process</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Virtual Machine</p>
<p>In order to wrap up an environment such that you can preserve it or pass it to
someone else, people have devised the concept of a Virtual Machine (VM). In
2022, there are innumerable ways to run a VM (VMware, Parallels, Multipass,
Docker, etc), each with its own tradeoffs. The important thing to remember is
that a Virtual Machine attempts to encapsulate an environment. Each of the
items in the above list (Notebook, IPython, IDE, etc) might be able to run
inside a virtual machine. If you are not provided with a perfectly functioning
environment it is often up to you to understand what you need for an execution
context and set it up for yourself; a VM of some variety frequently provides
some way to achieve this.</p>

<h2>Version Management<a class="headerlink" href="#version-management" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The primary reasons for using a version management system for  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dvmdostem</span></code>
are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>To maintain a meaningful history of the codebase so that the provenance
of the code is not in question.</p></li>
<li><p>To facilitate the addition or modification of code by many developers.</p></li>
<li><p>To maintain the ability to revert to or recover specific points in the
history of the codebase. This may be for the purpose of duplicating prior
work, or to recover a lost behavior of the software, or both.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are two (related) parts to fulfilling the above goals:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Making the commits (file diffs) easy to read and understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a strategy or pattern for bringing different lines of development
together.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If the file diffs are unreadable or the lines of development are not brought
together in an organized fashion, then the project history is harder to trust
which brings into question the provenance of the code, and makes it harder for
people to contribute.</p>

<h3>Version Control and Hosting<a class="headerlink" href="#version-control-and-hosting" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>

primary fork of the code (referred to as “upstream”) is currently hosted under
the ua-snap organization <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a>, so the primary (upstream) repository address is:

<p>It is important to make commits that are concise, organized, and readable,
thus fulfilling the goals of using a version control system. This comes
down to using git on a day-to-day basis and learning:</p>

<section id="tools">
<h4>Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#tools" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>It is possible to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code> purely from the command line, and in many
cases this is the easiest way to go. However for some people and some
situations a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is really helpful. Find a solution
that works for you and your computing platform! There are generally two major
functions of the Git GUIs, sometimes bundled in one application, and
sometimes not:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Viewing the project history.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding to the project history (making commits, pushing, pulling,
merging, rebasing).</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In 2022 there are many many graphical front ends to Git, and many text
editors and IDEs have built in support for at least some Git features. You
will need to find a tool that works for you. Although the interfaces look
antiquated, you might find that the programs Gitk (history viewer) and
Git Gui (for making commits) are perfectly sufficient, and these are
readily available on most systems. At the end of the day you are likely to
use a combination of the command line interface and a graphical frontend tool.</p>

<section id="setup">
<h4>Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#setup" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Your Git remote repositories should be appropriately named. This document
assumes that you are using the following convention:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The remote named origin should generally point to your fork of the
codebase, so the URL will look something like:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">https://github.com/&lt;your</span> <span class="pre">user</span> <span class="pre">name&gt;/dvm-dos-tem</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The remote named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">upstream</span></code> should generally point to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">https://github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git&#64;github.com:ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem.git</span></code> if you will be contributing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> that you go to the effort of making sure your
current git branch is displayed in your terminal shell prompt. There are many
examples floating around online of how to achieve this for all major operating
systems and shells; one example <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15883416/adding-git-branch-on-the-bash-command-prompt">here</a></p>

<h3>Branching Model<a class="headerlink" href="#branching-model" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>A generalized view of our branching model can be seen in the diagram:</p>
<!--From Google Drawing in
Shared Drive > DVM-DOS-TEM Documentation > drawings > branching_model
-->
<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRnnwNqLaMeWfcvUPI1BK47KVBAYJSGnOWoD_0fqoBwx27oRM1idQvZ0sS1Yaebr6bl7AcmNB1oAAjw/pub?w=960&amp;h=720"><p>The image shows one long-running branch (red commits; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code>), three topic
branches (green commits; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">issue-47</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">modify-dvm</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bugfix-4</span></code>) and
three “experiment branches’’ (gray commits; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exp-iem-0</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exp-akyrb-0</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exp-QCF-SA</span></code>).</p>
<p>Two of the topic branches have been merged (blue arrows). One of the topic
branches (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">modify-dvm</span></code>) will be merged in the future (dotted blue arrow). The
dark red commits on the master branch have been tagged to make an official
release of the code. The gray commits are for “experiment branches” which are
used to track a specific model run or set of model runs. Often the changes on
these branches are only to config and parameter files, but some experiments
might require code changes as well.</p>
<p>This diagram does not explicitly show interaction between multiple developers;
assume that each commit in the drawing could be made by any of the trusted
collaborators with push access to the upstream repository.</p>
<p>As a basic safety feature we have placed a restriction on the master branch of
the upstream repository such that only the administrators (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:tcarman2&#37;&#52;&#48;alaska&#46;edu">tcarman2<span>&#64;</span>alaska<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="mailto:rarutter&#37;&#52;&#48;alaska&#46;edu">rarutter<span>&#64;</span>alaska<span>&#46;</span>edu</a> ) are allowed push access. This restriction makes it
unlikely that a trusted collaborator can accidentally push something that breaks
the master branch. The best way for trusted collaborators to get code into the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">upstream/master</span></code> is to open a pull request from their topic branch (e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">upstream/topic-foo-bar</span></code>) into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">upstream/master</span></code> using the Github web
interface for pull requests. All interested parties then have an opportunity to
review the code, comment on Github, and push new commits to the topic branch (if
necessary). Only the administrators can merge the pull request.</p>
<p>As a general practice we try to have most work done in topic branches and merged
into master using Github pull requests. For some small changes (usually for
details that were inadvertently excluded from a recent pull request) we will
make commits directly on the master branch without using the topic branch/pull
request process. Using the topic branch/pull request process helps to organize
work and will provide a convenient place to run Github Actions, for example an
action to run the test suite before green-lighting a pull request for merging.</p>
<p>Recently (2022 and the several years prior) we have been using a single
long-running branch (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code>) and have been able to manage all contributions
by periodically merging topic branches. If the need arises we can switch back to
using an additional long-running branch. This would allow different levels of
stability as described in the <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows">Git Book Branching Workflows
section</a>.</p>
<p>In the event that you need work from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">upstream/master</span></code> in order to continue
the work on your topic branch, you can periodically merge <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">upstream/master</span></code>
into your topic branch. However please only use this when absolutely necessary
as it can make the history harder to read and the pull requests harder to
review. See this <a class="reference internal" href="#merge-or-rebase"><span class="std std-ref">Note</span></a> for a description of one
potential problem with merges.</p>
<div class="admonition note" id="merge-or-rebase">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>One problem with casually using merges in a workflow as opposed to using
rebase is that the default merge messages can:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Clutter the history.</p></li>
<li><p>Be very confusing if you end up changing a branch name at a later date.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For instance if you have a long-running branch with a large feature you are
working on and you need to get updates from upstream, if you choose to merge
into your “long-running-branch”:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git checkout long-running-branch
<span class="o">(</span>long-running-branch<span class="o">)</span>$ git pull upstream master
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then you will get a merge message by default that starts with something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Merge branch <span class="s1">&#39;master&#39;</span> from github.com:ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem into <span class="s1">&#39;long-running-branch&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All well and good, but later, once you work has evolved, you may decide to
change the name of long-running-branch to something more relevant:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>long-running-branch<span class="o">)</span>$ git checkout -b more-descriptive-name
<span class="o">(</span>more-descriptive-name<span class="o">)</span>$ git branch -D long-running-branch
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While renaming the branch is not a problem in and of itself, the merge commit
title will contain “…into ‘long-running-branch’”. The long- running-branch no
longer exists! So the merge commit message will be confusing to anyone who was
not involved with long-running-branch or forgot about it. Without good commit
messages, it is harder to understand the history and without a good
understanding of the history it is easy to lose control of the project. So
please learn to use rebase and merge appropriately!</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="workflow">
<h3>Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#workflow" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We are primarily using the “Centralized Workflow” described in the Git Book
<a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows">Distributed Workflows</a>. We have
a number of trusted developers at collaborating institutions and we grant them
write (push) access to the upstream repository. With this model, each developer
can push directly from their local repository to the upstream repository -
developers do not need to maintain their personal forks on Github (but are free
to do so if they wish).</p>
<p>If you are not one of our trusted collaborators and have contributions to make,
then you will need to follow the Git Book “Integration Manager Workflow”. You
will simply fork the upstream repository on Github, clone to your computer and
push changes back to your fork. You can then make a pull request from your fork
into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">upstream/master</span></code>.</p>
<p>When two or more developers want or need to work contemporaneously on a topic
branch, it is up to the developers to communicate and make sure that they do not
step on each other’s toes. In practice this simply amounts to communicating with
other folks via email, the <a class="reference external" href="https://arctic-eco-modeling.slack.com">Arctic Eco Modeling Slack</a>, or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ua-snap/dvm-dos-tem/issues">Github Issues</a> and
remembering to run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span> <span class="pre">--rebase</span></code>. Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--rebase</span></code> prevents
unnecessary merge commits that can make the history confusing and harder to
trust.</p>
<div class="admonition note" id="what-not-to-track">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A big part of maintaining a low friction workflow revolves around
understanding what types of files or information should not be included in
version control and figuring out how to exclude these files. The general
idea is that you don’t want to keep generated files (e.g.: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*.o</span></code>, or
Doxygen output), but you do want to track code that can generate certain
outputs. If you need the outputs, then you run the generating code to
produce it. The general rule is don’t track files that you can generate,
track the code to generate them.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note" id="personal-settings">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Another common sticking point is figuring out how to track host specific
settings, such as specific environment variables, build settings, or the
project settings files generated by many IDEs. You may need to devise your
own way to track these settings locally on an individual developer or
workstation level without pushing them to the central shared repository.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

<h2>Releases and Version Numbering<a class="headerlink" href="#releases-and-version-numbering" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Begining in 2021, we started using the “Releases” feature of Github to package

fully or nearly fully automated process but for the time being it is rather
manual.</p>
<p>As described in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HOWTO_RELEASE.md</span></code> document in the repo, the project uses
a three part version number: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>We use the following rules for incrementing the version number:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">

<li><p>The MINOR number (middle) will be updated when changes have been made
to science concepts, major implementation changes for scienctifc aspects
of the code calibration numbers are updated, or large new features are added.</p></li>
<li><p>The MAJOR (left) number will be updated for major milestones. This will
likely be points where the model is run for “production” or major testing and
validation steps are completed and documented.</p></li>

<h2>Testing and Deployment<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-and-deployment" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There is currently (Sept 2022) a very limited set of tests and their execution
is not automated. It is a goal to increase the test coverage and automate the
test exectution in the near future. We are hoping to setup a CI/CD pipeline
using Github Actions that can automatically test and deploy the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dvmdostem</span></code>
model and supporting tooling.</p>
<p>Testing is currently implemented for some of the Python scripts in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scripts/</span></code> directory using the Python <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctest</span></code> module. The style and
structure of tests reflects the challenges we have had getting testing intgrated
into this project. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctest</span></code> module has a nice feature that allows tests
to be written in a literate fashion with much explanatory text. This allows us
to hit several goals with one set of testing material:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>explanations and examples of code/script usage</p></li>
<li><p>testing across a wide range of encapsulation; for example some of the tests
are very granular unit tests of single functions in the script files, while
others test comprehensive behavior of entire modules and command line
interfaces</p></li>
<li><p>basic regression testing.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are two primary places that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctests</span></code> will show up:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__docstring__</span></code> of a given Python script or function.</p></li>
<li><p>In a standalone markdown file with specially formatted test code.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The tests that are in the docstrings of a given file or function should be very
narrow in their scope and should only check the functionality of that specific
function, independant from everything else, whereas tests in a standalone file
can be much broader and more flexible in their design.</p>
<p>At present we have had much more luck writing the broader tests (that also serve
as examples of usage) in stand alone files named with the following pattern:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scripts/doctests_*.md</span></code>. The files are markdown formatted with embedded code
that is executed by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctest</span></code> module. The execution context and other
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctest</span></code> particulars are described here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#what-s-the-execution-context">https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#what-s-the-execution-context</a></p>
<p>To run the tests that are in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__docstring__</span></code> s of a function or file:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> scripts
$ python -m doctest param_util.py   <span class="c1"># &lt;-- script name!</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To run the tests that are in an independent file:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> scripts
$ python -m doctest doctests_param_util.md  <span class="c1"># &lt;-- test file name!</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In either case, if all the tests execute successfully, then the command exits
silently. If there errors, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctest</span></code> package tried to point you towards
the tests that fail.</p>
